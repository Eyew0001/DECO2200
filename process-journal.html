        <p>As the population continues to grow, the demand for ambulance services is predicted to
          increase in a similar fashion. To keep up with this ever-growing demand, the current ambulance
          service system must be revised and further assessed. As we slowly start to welcome an autonomous
          technology driven future, there is potential to improve ambulance services even further by
          streamlining the procedure and improve response and further benefiting society. This project
          focuses on exploring how autonomous technologies can be integrated in emergency ambulance services
          to improve the overall process and experience. </p>

        <h3>Background Research</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12 text">
        <p>To better understand the context of our study and identify all problem areas, a combination of literary,
          interview and survey research regarding the current state of ambulance services was conducted. Mapping out
          all
          stakeholders involved with ambulance services brought us three major user groups: medical staff involved
          with
          ambulance services, caretakers, and regular users who have experienced calling or using ambulance services
          before.
          To cover as much ground as possible, each member individually chose one user group for the first stage of
          research,
          where I covered caretakers. </p>
      </div>
    </div>





    <div class="row back">

        <span class="img-caption">Affinity diagram identifying two key themes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>6 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 5 aged care workers and 1 primary school teacher to gain
          qualitative data on
          the perspective of those who are legally responsible for the wellbeing of another person. Questions
          regarding their experience
          and personal opinions on any services they've received and what factors contribute to a successful service
          were asked, providing
          further insight into any latent or tacit needs. </p>

        <p> As I review the responses, part of me questions how successful this first stage of research really was.
          Majority of the interviewees answered very similarly, which could just mean there is a sense of consistency
          with
          aged care practices. However there was little to no differences in personal experiences, as if they all
          worked for the
          same place. If I have to pinpoint the main reason for this, it would definitely be my flawed interviewing
          skills. Nervousness
          when interviewing strangers, lack of preparation as well as experience were probably the main factors that
          contributed to a lacklustre interview.
          Better choice of questions and active listening skills would have brought out deeper responses. However I
          have to make do with what I have.</p>


        <p> Analysis of the generally positive feedback collected
          resulted in the emergence of
          a central theme: the importance of communication and resources.
          Compiling this data with the rest of the team led to similar findings throughout all three user groups. </p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>To support the primary data I conducted further secondary research
          regarding these two emergent themes.
          Past studies presented statistical data and key results from not only caretakers but a variety of
          perspectives,
          providing deeper insight into the two main areas of communication and resources.
          Within these areas,
          specific issues arose:
          <ul>
            <li>majority of emergency calls being deemed non-urgent or low acuity, </li>
            <li>and the vital role communication plays in improving preparation, teamwork and service. </li>

        <p>A survey was conducted to gain a deeper understanding into the work experience of paramedics. The
          quantitative data
          collected would help provide additional support to the secondary research as well as provide statistical
          data specific to
          the key problem areas. Results showed that 48% of the 38 respondents
          found their services often not actually being medically required, with 49% feeling frustrated because of
          this.</p>

        <h3>Identifying Problem Areas</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>By compiling all of the research data with the rest of the team, it was clear that the key issues found
          where common with everyone.
          The first being that, majority of calls are classified as non-urgent, which ultimately puts unnecessary
          strain on emergency
          service resources. Additionally communication was found to be a vital contributor to a positive experience.
          Whether it be communication
          between dispatchers and patients,
          or between paramedics and dispatchers, lack of communication often resulted in confusion and delays in
          service.</p>

        <p>Using these key themes we conducted a brainstorming session regarding characteristics that we believe
          important to consider in our solution,
          and how it would tie in with user needs. Our combined research contains a wide range of perspectives so
          mapping out our
          thoughts on the same page helped provide a visualisation of how various themes and characteristics link to
          one another.</p>

      <div class="col-7">
        <p>After figuring out the user needs, the ideation stage begun for potential solutions. While churning out as
          many ideas as possible,
          each member added their solutions to the page. No matter how improbable they may seem, these ideas would
          serve as a
          warm up exercise to allow us to get in the right mood and context, and uncover as many possible solutions
          as possible. </p>

        <p>Each member chose their two best solutions and wrote a brief summary describing their chosen concepts.
          Passing the page
          along, members then added features they thought would improve the idea, continually building and expanding
          upon the base
          of the original design. Pros and cons were also added and discussed, to give us an idea of what the
          benefits of choosing
          this solution would be, as well as the possible limitations we would face. After thorough discussion of
          these pros and cons,
          our 3 optimal solutions were chosen. The chosen ideas were:
          <ul>
            <li>an ambulance triaging mobile application,</li>
            <li> a smart ambulance, and</li>
            <li>an autonomous equipment allocation system.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-7 left">
        <p>However after further discussion and feedback from our tutor, we felt that these ideas were still
          lacking as despite basing our ideas around our initial mind map of user needs and issues,
          we found the incorporation of our central theme, autonomous technologies, was very minimal for all of the
          designs.
        </p>

        <p>This realisation really dampened the team's morale. After spending a good 6 hours the previously coming up
          with our
          3 ideas, the fact that these ideas were not suitable led to worry about the future of this project.
          Additionally, coming up with ideas was mentally exhausting as there's a limit to our innovation
          capabilities, but
          nonetheless we had no choice. Thus, another round of ideation brainstorming took place, again each choosing
          their best
          idea to create a new set of 3. By analysing each of our ideas, we were fortunately able to decide on our
          new 3:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>medical chips,</li>
          <li> AI recognition street cameras, and </li>
          <li>autonomous traffic lights.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          After thoroughly reviewing these new
          ideas, we saw potential
          to integrate these features with our original 3 ideas.

        <h4>Drawbacks and Reflections</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>These rounds of ideation and brainstorming consumed more time than we had hoped, becoming definite
          setbacks for the team,
          towards both the schedule and our motivation. A considerable amount of time was spent coming up with a
          sound
          solution that considered not only the problem areas that we discovered, but also implemented autonomous
          technology.
          While the current state of autonomous technology is seeing slow but steady advancements, the idea has yet
          to become
          properly implemented in society. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>One thing we had to learn was to accept the futuristic nature of the context and to allow ourselves to
          think broader.
          Despite encouraging as many solutions as possible no matter how farfetched they may seem, when selecting
          probable features
          it was difficult to determine the line that separated the worlds of innovation, and outright science
          fiction. Due to our
          unfamiliarity with autonomous technology and its possibilities, we were unsure of what seemed plausible in
          the coming future.
          Additionally, novelty and originality was a personal goal for the team, even if there was no specific
          requirement for such.
          This led to hours of civil
          discourse within the group as we thoroughly discussed each and every idea's potential and limitations. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>In spite of all the time it took to finally come to a convincing agreement, all of these discussions
          really benefited us in the end,
          as it forced us to think deeper about each idea and contemplate various factors such as the necessity, the
          possibility,
          and the feasibility of these ideas.
          Our analysis made sure that we put extra thought into every aspect, so that we could only pick our best
          options.</p>

        <p>By incorporating various features, we decided upon creating an autonomous ecosystem. </p>

        <p>Via interacting with an interface, patients' injuries are triaged, prompting them to call
          ambulances when appropriate. The patient’s location, injury data and medical history would
          be analysed by the system to make autonomous decisions. Based on these decisions, any special
          equipment needed would be autonomously allocated to an autonomous ambulance via a rail system.
          This provides paramedics with vital information on the patient, and ensures the paramedics are
          thoroughly prepared before arrival.
        </p>

        <p>On route, the system will analyse and generate the most efficient route to reach the patient,
          changing traffic lights and improving traffic flow in the ambulance’s favour. The system additionally
          identifies the nearest hospital that would be able to take in the patient, creating a route from the
          scene to the hospital. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Upon further development and discussion, we discovered that our streetlamp design would not be able to
          cater for indoor
          cases. Though initially designed for outdoor use, a large number of calls do take place indoor, such as
          9.7% of calls being
          made up of elderly fall patients. For the reason that this idea could not cover indoor
          areas, it was
          decided that we could no longer continue with this design.</p>

        <h3>User Testing</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>For both solutions various screens were designed and tested with various users. Pre-testing surveys were
          conducted to
          identify our participants and their familiarity with the context presented, such as their experience with
          smartwatches
          and health related apps. Post-testing surveys were also held to collect statistical ratings of our designs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Think aloud testing was conducted to capture the organic thought process each participant had when
          interacting with the designs.
          Each participant was asked to complete a set of tasks where their time, errors, comments and observations
          were recorded as feedback.
          Three stages of testing were held with 20 unique users overall, with some participating in numerous rounds.
          This allowed us to collect
          feedback from new perspectives as well evaluations on any adjustments we made. It was also ensured that a
          participant from the medical
          industry was involved with testing for each round. These comparisons from a
          wide range of participants allowed for deeper insights into how users interacted with our interfaces.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Users tested with paper prototypes made to emulate our designed interfaces. While we attempted to visually
          represent the screens as accurately as was possible, there was still some difficulty in effectively
          representing
          digital interactions on paper for aspects such as camera scanning functions and animation elements. However
          despite
          this we believe were still able to collect thorough and rich data in spite of this issue.

      <div class="parallax first">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12 testpara">
        <p>The first round helped us identify many flaws with our mobile application. Issues with screen
          flow were presented when users were asked to triage for other people. Many found it difficult to
          comprehend the need for logging out, and failed to recognise logged in statuses.
          Only after explanations were given did they understand the need for this.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>In hindsight, our intended process to log out when triaging others was very unnecessarily confusing.
          While it's important that user's personal details don't get mixed up, at the time of conception logging out
          seemed like the best option. However it's quite obvious that this was not going to
          work out well without any sort of explanation. So this definitely needs to be heavily revised.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Due to the limited screen size of the smartwatch the main task we faced was designing an
          interface that was easy to navigate and access. While these issues were considered, navigation
          problems still presented themselves, with majority of users not being experienced with smartwatches
          and so found difficulty navigating due to the lack of instructions provided. However as smartwatches
          are catered for the wearer where triaging for different people was not an option, participants were
          quicker in understanding and using the smartwatch application, and were actually more in favour of the
          smartwatch.
          This discovery was quite interesting, and brought up the question
          of if whether or not revising the mobile application screen flow would change these results. </p>

      <div class="parallax second">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12 testpara">
        <p>For the second round the solutions were iterated upon with screen flow being adjusted and icons being
          redesigned,
          in which we received more balanced results this time. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>The mobile application saw a redesign in the triage process, which found much greater success than the
          first iteration.
          As we removed the need to log out and created a home page, users found it easier to understand switch
          between triaging
          for themselves and others. With the addition of a few new screens and change in screen
          flow, users found themselves lacking sufficient explanations of certain features. Users felt that more
          information was
          required, which tied into the need for further help and documentation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Other than a few navigation issues, we still found that users found task completion easier on smartwatches
          and were
          still more in favour of the smartwatch, mainly because the idea of wearables being used for medical
          purposes was believable
          as is common in society today. Thus users found themselves understanding the convenience of the smartwatch
          concept more than
          the mobile application.
          And for that reason we ultimately decided for our final solution to be the smartwatch application. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>However smartwatch applications must have a mobile counterpart and do not typically work as a
          standalone smartwatch application. So we decided to retain the login and account creation process of the
          mobile application. Our final solution would now consist of using the mobile application to create an
          account, while using the smartwatch for triaging and calling functions.

        <p>The screen designs went through a final round of iteration to improve clarity and create a high
          fidelity wireframe design that implemented specific aesthetic choices such as fonts and colour. This
          was done by using universal icons, as it was pointed out that some instructions such as 'OK' and 'Next'
          seemed vague in interpretation of what screen or direction it would take them to. Additionally, initial
          onboarding
          tutorial screens explaining the app functions was added to the mobile application.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Users were successful with navigating their way with both the mobile and smartwatch counterparts.
          Participants working in the medical industry advised for wording and visual hierarchy to be revised,
          as the choice of wording presented seemed to be misleading or open to misinterpretation, as well as
          believing that certain text elements are of higher priority than the icons. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>While we did have some new participants who had not seen these designs before, it is a wonder why a few of
          the
          feedback elements received was not brought up earlier. It is not really known why problems with wording did
          not
          come up in earlier iterations, though it could be because participants were focusing solely on the
          interactions
          rather than the text. Additionally, each iteration presents problems with the first aid icon, as users
          continually
          struggle to interpret the icons we've chosen. This is somewhat frustrating as we believe the final icon
          chosen is as
          straightforward as it gets and would prefer
          not to spell it out using text, but it seems this we have no choice but to resort to this.

        <h4>User Testing: Survey</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Participants were asked to rank overall ease of navigation and
          effectiveness on a 5 point Likert scale and these results (in addition to actual comments)
          were used to determine the overall reception to each of the interfaces and which of the
          two was more favoured. While we believe we carefully chose the right areas to inspect,
          it is possible that a few of the survey questions were a bit difficult to assess. Likert
          scale questions such as "how effective do you think this would be in a non-lethal emergency?"
          or "how easy was it to navigate?" were honestly at times difficult to gauge for a few users.
          Though these responses were necessary for our evaluations, it is possible that users' could not
          accurately answer due to themes such as "effectiveness" being hard to represent through a 5 point Likert
          scale.
          The data may have been more accurate had we worded the questions better.

          collected throughout our testing,
          and we believe that participants had a positive response to the designs so far. Based off of the feedback
          received from our final
          testing stage, appropriate modifications will be made to our high fidelity wireframes to develop the
          high-fidelity mock-up using
          InVision and emulate the proper digital interactive experience as accurately as possible.
