        <p>As the population continues to grow, the demand for ambulance services is predicted to increase in a similar
          fashion. To keep up with this ever-growing demand, the current ambulance service system must be revised and
          further assessed. As we slowly start to welcome an autonomous technology driven future, there is potential to
          improve ambulance services even further by streamlining the procedure and improve response and further
          benefiting society. This project focuses on exploring how autonomous technologies can be integrated in
          emergency ambulance services to improve the overall process and experience.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12 text">
        <p>To better understand the context of our study and identify all problem areas, a combination of literary,
          interview and survey research regarding the current state of ambulance services was conducted. Mapping out
          all stakeholders involved with ambulance services brought us three major user groups: medical staff involved
          with ambulance services, caretakers, and regular users who have experienced calling or using ambulance
          services before. To cover as much ground as possible, each member individually chose one user group for the
          first stage of research, where I covered caretakers.</p>

      <div class="col-6">
        <p>6 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 5 aged care workers over the phone and 1 primary school
          teacher in person to gain qualitative data on the perspective of those who are legally responsible for the
          wellbeing of another person. Questions regarding their routine, experience and personal opinions on any
          services they've received and what factors contribute to a successful service were asked, providing further
          insight into any latent or tacit needs. </p>

        <p>As I review the responses, part of me questions how successful this first stage of research really was.
          Majority of the interviewees answered very similarly, which could just mean there is a sense of consistency
          with aged care practices. However there was little to no differences in personal experiences, as if they all
          worked for the same place. If I were to pinpoint the main reason for this, it would definitely be my flawed
          interviewing skills. Nervousness when interviewing strangers, lack of preparation as well as experience were
          probably the main factors that contributed to a lacklustre interview. I believe that better choice of more
          open ended questions and active listening skills would have brought out deeper responses. </p>


        <p>Additionally due to their busy schedules, I had to resort to conducting the aged care interviews over the
          phone, which in my opinion affected both the atmosphere of the interview and my analysis of the feedback. As
          I could not determine facial observations or read body language, it was hard for me to create a
          conversation that flowed naturally, instead feeling very one sided. I was also very conscious of time because
          of how busy they were, which led me to rushing the interview. However I have to make do with what I
          have.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Analysis of the generally positive feedback resulted in the emergence of a central theme: the importance of
          communication and resources. Interviewees responded that "they more or less communicate" and "always give a
          time frame". They also knew how to cooperate with the paramedics, knowing what vitals and signs to look for
          helped speed up the treatment process and improve efficiency. The interviewees were pleased overall with
          their experiences with ambulance services thus far, and efficient communication and skills played a big part
          in this positive experience. </p>
        <p>Compiling this data with the rest of the team led to similar findings throughout all three user groups of
          the importance of communication and resources. Ambulance workers believed that efficiency was dependent on
          the stability of communication methods between all parties involved, and that ambulances being equipped with
          the bare minimum equipment to cover all situations potentially affected the quality of their services.
          Similarly, users who had experienced calling or using an ambulance before found that minimal communication
          between themselves and the workers lead to insecurity and anxiety as they were not properly informed of the
          situation, and found that some preferred not to use the service in less urgent situations due to the cost.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>To support the primary data, I conducted further secondary research regarding these two emergent themes by
          writing a literature review. Past studies presented statistical data and key results from not only caretakers
          but a variety of perspectives, which provided deeper insight into the two main areas of communication and
          resources. Within these areas, specific issues arose:
          <ul>
            <li>majority of emergency calls being deemed non-urgent or low acuity, </li>
            <li>and the vital role communication plays in improving preparation, teamwork and service. </li>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Findings found that majority of cases were classified as medically unnecessary (Camasso-Richardson, et al.,
          1997) but are more likely to believe that their illness required immediate care within an hour (Pearson et
          al., 2018), which ultimately affects the availability of services for high acuity cases. Strain on the
          emergency response system can lead to communication problems manifesting in paramedic teamwork (O’Meara,
          2003) in an environment where proper communication amongst all involved personnel is vital to improve joint
          decision making and collaboration (Harmsen et al., 2016), and helps keep not just the patient feeling secure
          but also the workers (Norden et al., 2014).

        <p>A survey was conducted to gain a deeper understanding into the work experience of paramedics. The
          quantitative data collected would help provide additional support to the secondary research as well as
          provide statistical data specific to the key problem areas. Responses were collected by posting to subreddit
          communities and survey exchange websites, since I had a detrimental lack of personal connections
          with paramedics and ambulance workers. This resulted in a successful collection of 38 responses.

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Results reiterated the importance of communication, with 71% stating knowing the chief complaint as the most
          important piece of information to know when dispatched, and 63% also stating location as the most important.
          Order of importance varied across responses however, with one even stating "Correct location is paramount,
          chief complaint is a luxury."</p>
        <p>The issue of low acuity calls was brought up again, with results showing that 48% of the 38 respondents
          found their services often not actually being medically required, with 49% feeling frustrated because of
          this.</p>

        <p>A few comments were made regarding the survey and the questions I asked, and I realise that multiple
          interpretations can affect the consistency of my data. In regards to the question "How often in your career
          have you got to the scene and your services were not actually required", one responder commented "I answered
          with 'cancelled on arrival' in mind. The number would have been much higher if I answered and considered
          services not required to mean - the patient only wanted a bandaid/panadol/to tell their teenage of for not
          getting home by curfew." While I in fact made the question with the latter interpretation in mind, the former
          interpretation helped me identify further reasons for ambulance services not being needed.</p>
        <p>As I was looking for data related to my two key areas of non-urgent cases and communication, my questions
          typically stayed within those themes. However because of this, one responder commented that it seemed my
          questions created the assumption that all paramedic work was related to emergency trauma responses when in
          reality most patients aren't sick and won't need any prehospital management. This data was in fact
          very valuable as it did support the key findings of my literature review, but it did mean that I did not
          properly explain the intention of my survey, so (ironically) better communication was needed in relaying the
          survey's purpose to help participants understand and respond more accurately.</p>

        <h3>Identifying Problem Areas</h3>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>After conducting our individual research, we compiled all of the research data and understood that the key
          issues we found individually were common with everyone on the team. The first being that, majority of calls
          are classified as non-urgent, which ultimately puts unnecessary strain on emergency service resources.
          Additionally communication was found to be a vital contributor to a positive experience. Whether it be
          communication between dispatchers and patients, or between paramedics and dispatchers, lack of communication
          often resulted in confusion and delays in service.</p>

        <p>Using these key themes we conducted a brainstorming session regarding characteristics that we believe
          important to consider in our solution, and how it would tie in with user needs. Our combined research
          contains a wide range of perspectives so mapping out our thoughts on the same page helped provide a
          visualisation of how various themes and characteristics link to one another. </p>

      <div class="col-7">
        <p>After figuring out the user needs, the ideation stage begun for potential solutions. While churning out as
          many ideas as possible, each member added their solutions to the page. No matter how improbable they may
          seem, these ideas would serve as a warm up exercise to allow us to get in the right mood and context, and
          uncover as many possible solutions as possible.
        </p>

        <p>Each member chose their two best solutions and wrote a brief summary describing their chosen concepts.
          Passing the page along, members then added features they thought would improve the idea, continually building
          and expanding upon the base of the original design. Pros and cons were also added and discussed, to give us
          an idea of what the benefits of choosing this solution would be, as well as the possible limitations we would
          face. After thorough discussion of these pros and cons and through process of elimination, our 3 optimal
          solutions were chosen. The chosen ideas were:
          <ul>
            <li>an ambulance triaging mobile application,</li>
            <li> a smart ambulance, and</li>
            <li>an autonomous equipment allocation system.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>We believe that these ideas covered both key points the range of these ideas covered both key points. A mobile application was suitable for
          covering interactions for users wishing to use ambulance services and help determine what emergencies were
          considered urgent. A smart autonomous ambulance was proposed with the concept of helping to efficiently
          distribute resources of paramedics and drivers to focus on more urgent calls when needed, and an autonomous
          equipment allocation system would assist ambulance workers in improving resources and their services.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-7 left">
        <p>However after further discussion and feedback from our tutor, we felt that these ideas were still lacking as
          despite basing our ideas around our initial mind map of user needs and issues, we found the incorporation of
          our central theme, autonomous technologies, was very minimal for all of the designs.
        </p>

        <p>This realisation really dampened the team's morale. After spending a good 6 hours previously coming up
          with our
          3 ideas, the fact that these ideas were not suitable led us to worry about the future of this project.
          Additionally, coming up with ideas was mentally exhausting as there's a limit to our innovation
          capabilities, but
          nonetheless we had no choice. Thus, another round of ideation brainstorming took place, again each choosing
          their best
          idea to create a new set of 3. By analysing each of our ideas, we were fortunately able to decide on our
          new 3:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>medical chips,</li>
          <li> AI recognition street cameras, and </li>
          <li>autonomous traffic lights.</li>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Medical chips were chosen for the potential of creating a concept that was personalised to the users, street
          cameras for implementing a public presence that was accessible to everyone, and autonomous traffic lights
          were chosen as Annie (fellow team member) saw potential in implementing this feature as she came across it in
          her
          individual research. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          After thoroughly reviewing these new
          ideas, we saw potential
          to integrate these features with our original 3 ideas.

        <p>These rounds of ideation and brainstorming consumed more time than we had hoped, becoming definite
          setbacks for the team,
          towards both the schedule and our motivation. A considerable amount of time was spent coming up with a
          sound
          solution that considered not only the problem areas that we discovered, but also implemented autonomous
          technology.
          While the current state of autonomous technology is seeing slow but steady advancements, the idea has yet
          to become
          properly implemented in society. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>One thing we had to learn was to accept the futuristic nature of the context and to allow ourselves to
          think broader.
          Despite encouraging as many solutions as possible no matter how farfetched they may seem, when selecting
          probable features
          it was difficult to determine the line that separated the worlds of innovation, and downright science
          fiction. Due to our
          unfamiliarity with autonomous technology and its possibilities, we were unsure of what seemed plausible in
          the coming future.
          Additionally, novelty and originality was a personal goal for the team, even if there was no specific
          requirement for such.
          This led to hours of civil
          discourse within the group as we thoroughly discussed each and every idea's potential and limitations. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>In spite of all the time it took to finally come to a convincing agreement, all of these discussions
          really benefited us in the end,
          as it forced us to think deeper about each idea and contemplate various factors such as the necessity, the
          possibility,
          and the feasibility of these ideas.
          Our analysis made sure that we put extra thought into every aspect, so that we could only pick our best
          options.</p>

        <p>By incorporating various features, we decided upon creating an autonomous ecosystem. </p>

        <p>Via interacting with an interface, patients' injuries are triaged, prompting them to call
          ambulances when appropriate. The patient’s location, injury data and medical history would
          be analysed by the system to make autonomous decisions. Based on these decisions, any special
          equipment needed would be autonomously allocated to an autonomous ambulance via a rail system.
          This provides paramedics with vital information on the patient, and ensures the paramedics are
          thoroughly prepared before arrival.
        </p>

        <p>On route, the system will analyse and generate the most efficient route to reach the patient,
          changing traffic lights and improving traffic flow in the ambulance’s favour. The system additionally
          identifies the nearest hospital that would be able to take in the patient, creating a route from the
          scene to the hospital. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Upon further development and discussion, we discovered that our streetlamp design would not be able to
          cater for indoor
          cases. Though initially designed for outdoor use, a large number of calls do take place indoor, such as
          9.7% of calls being
          made up of elderly fall patients. For the reason that this idea could not cover indoor
          areas, it was
          decided that we could no longer continue with this design.</p>

        <h3>User Testing</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>For both solutions various screens were designed and tested with various users. Pre-testing surveys were
          conducted to
          identify our participants and their familiarity with the context presented, such as their experience with
          smartwatches
          and health related apps. Post-testing surveys were also held to collect statistical ratings of our designs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Think aloud testing was conducted to capture the organic thought process each participant had when
          interacting with the designs.
          Each participant was asked to complete a set of tasks where their time, errors, comments and observations
          were recorded as feedback.
          Three stages of testing were held with 20 unique users overall, with some participating in numerous rounds.
          This allowed us to collect
          feedback from new perspectives as well evaluations on any adjustments we made. It was also ensured that a
          participant from the medical
          industry was involved with testing for each round. These comparisons from a
          wide range of participants allowed for deeper insights into how users interacted with our interfaces.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Users tested with paper prototypes made to emulate our designed interfaces. While we attempted to visually
          represent the screens as accurately as was possible, there was still some difficulty in effectively
          representing
          digital interactions on paper for aspects such as camera scanning functions and animation elements. However
          despite
          this we believe were still able to collect thorough and rich data in spite of this issue.

      <div class="col-md-12 testpara">
        <p>For the first round of testing we tested with a total of 9 unique users. </p>
        <p>The first round helped us identify many flaws with our mobile application. Issues with screen
          flow were presented when users were asked to triage for other people. Many found it difficult to
          comprehend the need for logging out, and failed to recognise logged in statuses.
          Only after explanations were given did they understand the need for this.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>During testing I made a personal decision only to explain the bare minimum of the application to my 3
          participants in order to get a natural reaction and for them to compare their expectations of the app to
          their own frame of reference, as well as simulate potential situations. However this ended up creating
          problems when I realised how flawed our design was. In hindsight, our intended process to log out when
          triaging others was unnecessarily confusing. While it's important that user's personal details don't get
          mixed up, at the time of conception logging out seemed like the best option. However it's quite obvious that
          this was not going to work out well without any sort of explanation. So this definitely needs to be heavily
          revised.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Due to the limited screen size of the smartwatch the main task we faced was designing an
          interface that was easy to navigate and access. While these issues were considered, navigation
          problems still presented themselves, with majority of users not being experienced with smartwatches
          and so found difficulty navigating due to the lack of instructions provided. However as smartwatches
          are catered for the wearer where triaging for different people was not an option, participants were
          quicker in understanding and using the smartwatch application, and were actually more in favour of the
          smartwatch.
          This discovery was quite interesting, and brought up the question
          of if whether or not revising the mobile application screen flow would change these results. </p>

        <p>For the second round the solutions were iterated upon with the screen flow being adjusted and icons being
          redesigned, in which we received more balanced results this time. 11 tests were conducted overall, with some
          participants being brought back from the first round of testing. I also learnt my mistakes of not explaining
          enough, so for my new participants I touched on a few more important features but still tried to not give away too
          much information. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>The mobile application saw a redesign in the triage process, which found much greater success than the
          first iteration.
          As we removed the need to log out and created a home page, users found it easier to understand switch
          between triaging
          for themselves and others. With the addition of a few new screens and change in screen
          flow, users found themselves lacking sufficient explanations of certain features. Users felt that more
          information was
          required, which tied into the need for further help and documentation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Other than a few navigation issues, we still found that users found task completion easier on smartwatches
          and were
          still more in favour of the smartwatch, mainly because the idea of wearables being used for medical
          purposes was believable
          as is common in society today. Thus users found themselves understanding the convenience of the smartwatch
          concept more than
          the mobile application.
          And for that reason we ultimately decided for our final solution to be the smartwatch application. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>However smartwatch applications must have a mobile counterpart and do not typically work as a
          standalone smartwatch application. So we decided to retain the login and account creation process of the
          mobile application. Our final solution would now consist of using the mobile application to create an
          account, while using the smartwatch for triaging and calling functions.

        <p>The screen designs went through a final round of iteration to improve clarity and create a high
          fidelity wireframe design that implemented specific aesthetic choices such as fonts and colour. This
          was done by using universal icons, as it was pointed out that some instructions such as 'OK' and 'Next'
          seemed vague in interpretation of what screen or direction it would take them to. Additionally, initial
          onboarding
          tutorial screens explaining the app functions was added to the mobile application. This round we saw
          ourselves conducting 10 tests.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Users were successful with navigating their way with both the mobile and smartwatch counterparts. Jiyoung's
          (fellow team member) participants working in the medical industry advised for wording and visual hierarchy to
          be revised, as the choice of wording presented seemed to be misleading or open to misinterpretation, as well
          as believing that certain text elements are of higher priority than the icons. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>While we did have some new participants who had not seen these designs before, it is a wonder why a few of
          the feedback elements received were not brought up earlier. It is not really known why problems with wording
          did not come up in earlier iterations, though it could be because during the first few rounds participants
          were focusing solely on the interactions rather than the text, or just simply that these were new
          participants. Additionally, each iteration presents problems with the first aid icon, as users continually
          struggle to interpret the icons we've chosen. This is somewhat frustrating as we believe the final icon
          chosen is as straightforward as it gets and would prefer not to spell it out for them using text, but it
          seems this we have no choice but to resort to this.

        <p>Participants were asked to rank overall ease of navigation and
          effectiveness on a 5 point Likert scale and these results (in addition to actual comments)
          were used to determine the overall reception to each of the interfaces and which of the
          two was more favoured. While we believe we carefully chose the right areas to inspect,
          it is possible that a few of the survey questions were a bit difficult to assess. Likert
          scale questions such as "how effective do you think this would be in a non-lethal emergency?"
          or "how easy was it to navigate?" were honestly at times difficult to gauge for a few users.
          Though these responses were necessary for our evaluations, it is possible that users could not
          accurately answer due to themes such as "effectiveness" being hard to represent through a 5 point Likert
          scale.

          off of the feedback received from our final testing stage, appropriate modifications were made to our high

          rounds of testing. These tests were conducted by getting the participants to interact with the digital
          InVision prototype. This time we also managed to receive further feedback from a few tutors from our
          university, who due to their experience in their crafts, helped us identify various design flaws and
          potentials.

          For our mobile application it was suggested for more help and documentation to be added to various pages, for
          further adjustments to once again be made to our choice of wording and phrasings, as well as actually
          providing functionality to a few of our buttons so to flesh out the prototype more. Furthermore the addition

          potential for storing and displaying users' regular GP for easy contact, however due to time constraints and
          InVision limitations we believed that showing nearby GPs was sufficient for now.

        <p>
          Additionally, the inclusion of a colour blind mode was added due to feedback from one of our medical
          professional participants (Stephanie) to improve accessibility. Personally I found this inclusion quite
          questionable, as I don't believe our design to be so heavily dependent on colour that would warrant the need
          for a colour blind mode, and believe that other disabilities could've been demonstrated instead. However a
          medical professional clearly possesses more knowledge in this subject than I or anyone else in this team, so
          the function was included, and demonstrated that the list of accessibility features could potentially be
          expanded upon in the future.
