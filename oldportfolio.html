      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p><i>Smart Triaging</i> is a design project that revolves around designing interactions for autonomous
          technologies.
          The team focused on how autonomous technologies could be used to streamline emergency ambulance services, so
          to meet
          the ever-growing demand. This resulted in the conception of <i>Smart Triaging</i>: a futuristic triaging
          smartwatch application
          that
          alerts the user of any medical injuries and allows them to call for an ambulance for that injury straight
          from their smartwatch.

        <p>The application works in conjunction with a proposed autonomous ecosystem. When the user requests for an
          ambulance via the smartwatch, an alarm will be sent to the ambulance service. The system autonomously
          analyses the received data and decides whether the ambulance needs to be equipped with appropriate
          specialised equipment. Data regarding the user's injury, medical history, will be available for the EMTs to
          access on route within the ambulance. Users are to sign up via a mobile application, and use the smartwatch
          application for triaging and calling.
        </p>
        <p>The overall concept was designed to improve communication between all involved parties, maintain and improve
          service quality and help emergency services better allocate resources to meet the increasing demand for these
          services.</p>

        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>A mixture of primary and secondary research was conducted via interviews, surveys and literature reviews.
          Through this two key problem areas arose, serving the basis for our idea conception stage:
          <li>the importance of communication with all related parties, and </li>
          <li>the strain non urgent calls were placing on limited resources.</li>
        </p>
        <p id="quote"><i>“proper communication amongst all
            involved personnel is vital to improve joint
            decision making and collaboration, and helps
            enable a shared sense of situational awareness
            amongst co-workers (Harmsen et al., 2016).”</i></p>

        <h4>Design & Ideation</h4>
        <p>Taking these key themes into consideration, the ideation stage begun through various brainstorming,
          iterative design sessions and thorough discussions. Implementing autonomous technologies was a challenging
          task that resulted in a continual shift in focus
          between different user groups. Should the solution be designed for the paramedics, or the regular callers? It
          was a complex question that required much thought, by experimenting with various drafts of ideas.</p>
        <p>
          Through a continual process of iteration and feedback, we came up with multiple features that we believed
          would complement
          each other well in an overarching system. This led to the design of our autonomous ecosystem, triggered by a
          digital application.</p>

        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <p>Multiple rounds of testing were conducted with a range of participants. Initial tests were conducted on
          paper prototypes of two different interfaces, a mobile and smartwatch interface. By assigning the
          participants various tasks, feedback was collected via their comments, errors and general observations of
          their behaviour. Analysing the feedback received allowed us to iterate upon the designs, and ultimately
          directed us to choose the smartwatch design as our final main interface.
        </p>
        <p>Testing was then conducted with our interactive prototypes, where we applied the feedback to iterate upon
          and reach our final design.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>This was a very challenging project that the team initially approached with much apprehension. With such a
          difficult and complicated topic as emergency services, each idea that the team came up with ultimately felt
          lacking and our confidence faltered as we entered further into the ideation stage. However we eventually
          found a solution that worked around our worries, by focusing on indirectly providing assistance to the solve
          the problem areas, rather than trying to automate the actual paramedic service.</p>
        <p>There is much room for the concept to be improved. While many rounds of testing was conducted with our
          interfaces, testing and user feedback never really ends, so more changes and improvements can be made to
          our design interfaces. Additionally, the autonomous system could be further fleshed out and improve any
          imperfections that we may have overlooked.</p>
