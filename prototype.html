          <p>As the population continues to grow, the demand for ambulance services is predicted to
            increase in a similar fashion. To keep up with this ever-growing demand, the current ambulance
            service system must be revised and further assessed. As we slowly start to welcome an autonomous
            technology driven future, there is potential to improve ambulance services even further by
            streamlining the procedure and improve response and further benefiting society. This project
            focuses on exploring how autonomous technologies can be integrated in emergency ambulance services
            to improve the overall process and experience. </p>

          <p>To better understand the context of our study and identify all problem areas, a combination of literary,
            interview and survey research regarding the current state of ambulance services was conducted. Mapping out
            all
            stakeholders involved with ambulance services brought us three major user groups: medical staff involved
            with
            ambulance services, caretakers, and regular users who have experienced calling or using ambulance services
            before.
            To cover as much ground as possible, each member individually chose one user group for the first stage of
            research,
            where I covered caretakers. </p>

          <p>6 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 5 aged care workers and 1 primary school teacher to gain
            qualitative data on
            the perspective of those who are legally responsible for the wellbeing of another person. Questions
            regarding their experience
            and personal opinions on any services they've received and what factors contribute to a successful service
            were asked, providing
            further insight into any latent or tacit needs. Analysis of the generally positive feedback collected
            resulted in the emergence of
            a central theme: the importance of communication and resources.
            Compiling this data with the rest of the team led to similar findings throughout all three user groups. </p>

          <p>To support the primary data collected, further secondary research was conducted regarding these two
            emergent themes.
            Past studies presented statistical data and key results from not only caretakers but a variety of
            perspectives,
            providing deeper insight into the two main areas of communication and resources. Within these areas,
            specific issues arose:
            <li>majority of emergency calls being deemed non-urgent or low acuity, </li>
            <li>and the vital role communication plays in improving preparation, teamwork and service. </li>

            data specific to
            the key problem areas. Results showed that 48% of the 38 respondents
            found their services often not actually being medically required, with 49% feeling frustrated because of

          <p>By compiling all of the research data with the rest of the team, it was clear that the key issues found
            where common with everyone.
            The first being that, majority of calls are classified as non-urgent, which ultimately puts unnecessary
            strain on emergency
            service resources. Additionally communication was found to be a vital contributor to a positive experience.
            Whether it be communication
            between dispatchers and patients,
            or between paramedics and dispatchers, lack of communication often resulted in confusion and delays in

            mapping out our

            many ideas as possible,
            each member added their solutions to the page. No matter how improbable they may seem, these ideas would
            serve as a
            warm up exercise to allow us to get in the right mood and context, and uncover as many possible solutions
            as possible. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Each member chose their two best solutions and wrote a brief summary describing their chosen concepts.
            Passing the page
            along, members then added features they thought would improve the idea, continually building and expanding
            upon the base
            of the original design. Pros and cons were also added and discussed, to give us an idea of what the
            benefits of choosing
            this solution would be, as well as the possible limitations we would face. After thorough discussion of
            these pros and cons,
            our 3 optimal solutions were chosen. The chosen ideas were: an ambulance triaging mobile application, a
            smart ambulance,
            and an autonomous equipment allocation system.
          </p>

          <p>However we felt that these ideas were still lacking as we despite basing our ideas around our initial mind
            map of user
            needs and issues, we found the incorporation of our central theme, autonomous technologies, was very
            minimal for all of
            the designs. Thus, another round of ideation brainstorming took place, again each choosing their best idea
            to create a
            new set of 3. These new features were: medical chips, AI Recognition street cameras and autonomous traffic
            lights. After
            thoroughly discussing the potential of these new ideas, we saw potential to integrate these features with
            our original 3 ideas.

            be analysed by the system to make autonomous decisions. Based on these decisions, any special
            equipment needed would be autonomously allocated to an autonomous ambulance via a rail system.
            This provides paramedics with vital information on the patient, and ensures the paramedics are
            thoroughly prepared before arrival.

          <p>On route, the system will analyse and generate the most efficient route to reach the patient,

          <p>It was decided that to benefit staff and help improve quality of service, we needed to target regular
            callers
            as they are the main reason that these services are needed in the first place, and are the main users that
            dictate
            the flow of the system. Three interfaces were designed to interact with the system:

            <li> Futuristic street lamps that used sensors and cameras to autonomously detect and triage certain
              injuries in public areas,
              with this solution taking much influence from AI recognition. </li>

            <li>A smartwatch application that would use sensors to detect bodily injuries on the wearer, with this
              solution taking much influence from the idea of medical chips. </li>
            <li>Mobile triaging application that would use AI recognition to scan and detect any injuries or illnesses.</li>

          <p>Upon further development and discussion, we discovered that our streetlamp design would not be able to
            cater for indoor
            cases. Though initially designed for outdoor use, a large number of calls do take place indoor, such as
            9.7% of calls being
            made up of elderly fall patients (Cox, et al., 2018). For the reason that this idea could not cover indoor
            areas, it was
            decided that we could no longer continue with this design.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>These rounds of ideation and brainstorming consumed more time than we had hoped, becoming definite
            setbacks for the team,
            towards both the schedule and our motivation. A considerable amount of time was spent coming up with a
            sound
            solution that considered not only the problem areas that we discovered, but also implemented autonomous
            technology.
            While the current state of autonomous technology is seeing slow but steady advancements, the idea has yet
            to become
            properly implemented in society. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>One thing we had to learn was to accept the futuristic nature of the context and to allow ourselves to
            think broader.
            Despite encouraging as many solutions as possible no matter how farfetched they may seem, when selecting
            probable features
            it was difficult to determine the line that separated the worlds of innovation, and outright science
            fiction. Due to our
            unfamiliarity with autonomous technology and its possibilities, we were unsure of what seemed plausible in
            the coming future.
            Additionally, novelty and originality was a personal goal for the team, even if there was no specific
            requirement for such.
            This led to hours of civil
            discourse within the group as we thoroughly discussed each and every idea's potential and limitations. </p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>In spite of all the time it took to finally come to a convincing agreement, all of these discussions
            really benefited us in the end,
            as it forced us to think deeper about each idea and contemplate various factors such as the necessity, the
            possibility,
            and the feasibility of these ideas.
            Our analysis made sure that we put extra thought into every aspect, so that we could only pick our best
            options.</p>

            identify our participants and their familiarity with the context presented, such as their experience with
            smartwatches

          <p>Think aloud testing was conducted to capture the organic thought process each participant had when

            Each participant was asked to complete a set of tasks where their time, errors, comments and observations
            were recorded as feedback.
            Three stages of testing were held with 20 unique users overall, with some participating in numerous rounds.
            This allowed us to collect
            feedback from new perspectives as well evaluations on any adjustments we made. It was also ensured that a
            participant from the medical
            industry was involved with testing for each round. These comparisons from a
            wide range of participants allowed for deeper insights into how users interacted with our interfaces.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Users tested with paper prototypes made to emulate our designed interfaces. While we attempted to visually

            representing
            digital interactions on paper for aspects such as camera scanning functions and animation elements. However
            despite
            this we believe were still able to collect thorough and rich data in spite of this issue.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>The first round helped us identify many flaws with our mobile application. Issues with screen
            flow were presented when users were asked to triage for other people. Many found it difficult to
            comprehend the need for logging out, and failed to recognise logged in statuses.
            Only after explanations were given did they understand the need for this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Due to the limited screen size of the smartwatch the main task we faced was designing an
            interface that was easy to navigate and access. While these issues were considered, navigation
            problems still presented themselves, with majority of users not being experienced with smartwatches
            and so found difficulty navigating due to the lack of instructions provided. However as smartwatches
            are catered for the wearer where triaging for different people was not an option, participants were
            quicker in understanding and using the
            smartwatch application, and were actually more in favour of the smartwatch. </p>
        </div>

          <h3>User Testing: Second Stage</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>For the second round the solutions were iterated upon with screen flow being adjusted and icons being
            redesigned,
            in which we received more balanced results this time. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>The mobile application saw a redesign in the triage process, which found much greater success than the
            first iteration.
            As we removed the need to log out and created a home page, users found it easier to understand switch
            between triaging
            for themselves and others. With the addition of a few new screens and change in screen
            flow, users found themselves lacking sufficient explanations of certain features. Users felt that more
            information was
            required, which tied into the need for further help and documentation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Other than a few navigation issues, we still found that users found task completion easier on
            smartwatches, simply
            because the idea of wearables being used for medical purposes was believable as is common in society today.
            Thus users
            found themselves understanding the convenience of the smartwatch concept more than the mobile application.
            And for that reason we ultimately decided for our final solution to be the smartwatch application. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>However smartwatch applications must have a mobile counterpart and do not typically work as a
            standalone smartwatch application. So we decided to retain the login and account creation process of the
            mobile application. Our final solution would now consist of using the mobile application to create an
            account, while using the smartwatch for triaging and calling functions.

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>The screen designs went through a final round of iteration to improve clarity and create a high
            fidelity wireframe design that implemented specific aesthetic choices such as fonts and colour. This
            was done by using universal icons, as it was pointed out that some instructions such as 'OK' and 'Next'
            seemed vague in interpretation of what screen or direction it would take them to. Additionally, initial
            onboarding
            tutorial screens explaining the app functions was added to the mobile application.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Users were successful with navigating their way with both the mobile and smartwatch counterparts.
            Participants working in the medical industry advised for wording and visual hierarchy to be revised,
            as the choice of wording presented seemed to be misleading or open to misinterpretation, as well as
            believing that certain text elements are of higher priority than the icons. </p>

          <p>While we carefully chose the right questions to collect relevant data, it is possible
            that a few of the questions were a bit difficult to assess. Likert scale questions such as
            "how effective do you think this would be in a non-lethal emergency?" or "how easy was it to
            navigate?" were honestly at times difficult to gauge for a few users. Though these responses
            were necessary for our evaluations, it is possible that users' could not accurately answer due to
            themes such as "effectiveness" being hard to represent through a 5 point Likert scale. Additionally
            the fact that people typically choose the middle option when they wish to avoid
            answering a question is a problem that may are may not have affected the accuracy of the results.</p>
