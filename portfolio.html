                <p><i>Smart Triaging</i> is a design project that revolves around designing interactions for autonomous
                    technologies. The team focused on how autonomous technologies could be used to streamline emergency
                    ambulance services so to meet the ever-growing demand. This resulted in the conception of <i>Smart
                        Triaging: </i>a futuristic triaging smartwatch application that automatically scans the user's
                    body and alerts them of any medical injuries, allowing them to call for an ambulance for that
                    injury straight from their smartwatch.

                <p>The application works in conjunction with a proposed autonomous ecosystem. When the user requests
                    for an ambulance via their smartwatch, an alarm will be sent to the ambulance service. The system
                    autonomously analyses the received data and decides whether the ambulance needs to be equipped with
                    appropriate specialised equipment. Data regarding the user's injury, medical history, will be
                    available for the EMTs to access on route within the ambulance.

                <p>The concept was designed to improve communication between all involved parties, maintain and improve
                    service quality, as well as help ambulance services better allocate resources to meet the
                    increasing demand for these services.</p>

                <p>A mixture of primary and secondary research was conducted via interviews, surveys and literature

                    <li>the importance of communication with all related parties, and </li>

                <p>Taking these key themes into consideration, the ideation stage begun through various brainstorming,
                    iterative design sessions and thorough discussions. Implementing autonomous technologies was a
                    challenging task that resulted in a continual shift in focus between different user groups. Should
                    the solution be designed for the paramedics, or for the regular callers? How prominent of a role
                    should
                    autonomous technologies be playing in the forefront of the solution? These were complex questions
                    that we attempted to solve by drafting up numerous ideas, and meticulously discussing the pros and
                    cons of each.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>In addition to two the key themes, factors of necessity, possibility, and feasibility were carefully
                    evaluated with each idea. With such a complicated and unfamiliar topic as autonomous technologies,
                    often the various ideas found themselves lacking, and dangerously treading the lines of ambitious
                    innovation and
                    science fiction, something that needed to be avoided. The ideation stage was mentally taxing on the
                    team as we struggled to come up with a solution that satisfied all these areas, as well as
                    something that we as a team could personally be proud of.
                </p>
                <p>Through a harsh continual process of iteration and feedback from tutors, ideas were cut, added, and
                    refined. This resulted in multiple features that we believed would complement each other well in an
                    overarching system. By switching our focus to indirectly providing assistance to solve the problem
                    areas rather than trying to automate the actual paramedic service, we were led to the design of our
                    autonomous ecosystem, triggered by a digital application.

                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>Multiple rounds of testing were conducted with a range of participants, some professionally involved
                    in the medical industry. Initial tests were conducted on paper prototypes of two competing
                    interfaces, a mobile and smartwatch interface. By assigning the participants various tasks of
                    navigating both interfaces, feedback was collected via their comments, errors, general observations
                    of their behaviour, as well as an additional survey for each design iteration. The mobile interface
                    initially also possessed the capability to triage injuries, but was later revoked due to the
                    smartwatch receiving a more positive reception for its convenience.
                </p>
                <p>Initial feedback revealed underlying issues with screen flow, choice of icons and other design
                    elements, as well as the need for further documentation. Analysing this feedback allowed us to
                    iterate
                    further upon the designs.

                <p>By creating a high fidelity mock-up, rounds of testing were conducted where the feedback began to
                    see a change of focus on more detailed elements such as wording and aesthetic design choices.
                    Applying the additional feedback, we were able to reach our final design.

                <p>There is much room for the interfaces to be improved upon. While many rounds of testing were
                    conducted with our interfaces, testing and user feedback never really ends. Feedback received from
                    our final round of testing suggested potential for further expansion in functionality and account
                    personalisation, as well as providing more detailed medical information.

                <p>This was a very challenging project that the team initially approached with much apprehension, but
                    concluded with feelings of content. In addition to the unexplored world of autonomous services,
                    ambulance services was not an area we possessed extensive knowledge in, thus widening the scope of
                    unknown territory. A few regretful mistakes were made, such as interview and testing rounds that
                    could've been more smoothly executed, but all in all we believe that this was a successful project.
                    Only through the 12 weeks of continual civil discourse and fluctuations of success, would we be
                    exposed to these valuable learning experiences.
